          Apart from being a mainframe application & web developer, I enjoy most
          of my time being outdoors. Listening musics and love to hear tamil
          literature novels. Interested to play Badminton and the outdoor games
          like Cricket with friends.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">
          I enjoyed to watch movies and television shows and I spend a large
          amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in
          the front-end web development world.
